Cartridge Recycle Problem

Given : 
Four input parameters:
Cartridges, Dollars, recycleReward, perksCost.

One has two options:

1. Recycle one cartridge and get recycleReward amount of dollars
2. Combine one cartridge and perksCost amount to get a perk item.

Need to maximise the perk items one can buy.

Eg: 10, 10, 2, 2

Initially there are 10 cartridges, 10 dollars with the person.
If the person recycles 3 cartridges he has 7 cartridges and 16 dollars (10 initial + 3*2(recycleReward)).

Combining 7 cartridges and 14 dollars to buy 7 perk items(as each item costs 1 cartridge and 2 dollars(perksCost)), 
max perks that can be bought is 7.
